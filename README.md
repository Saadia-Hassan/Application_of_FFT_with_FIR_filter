# Application_of_FFT_with_FIR_filter
This project will walk you through the importance of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which is one of the major computation techniques in the world of Digital Signal Processing (DSP). It also explains how 'Filter Design Toolbox' can be made use of in MATLAB to design desired filters on the go.
